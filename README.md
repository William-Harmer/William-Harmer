# Hi There, I'm Will 👋
I’m a Computer Science graduate from the University of East Anglia with a passion for anything computers! I love exploring how systems work, from low-level internals to full stack apps, and turning ideas into clean, reliable software. I’m eager to become a better programmer and keep improving my skills. If you have any feedback or would like to collaborate, I’d love to hear from you. Please feel free to get in touch.
## Currently Working On: 🚧
- 🔐 **[SimpleWarden](https://github.com/William-Harmer/simplewarden)**  
    A tool that syncs email aliases between [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) to keep the aliases consistent and up to date.
## Other Projects: 🛠️
- 🧠 **[Comparative Analysis of SAT Solvers](https://github.com/William-Harmer/sat-solvers)**  
    An undergraduate research project exploring the design, optimisation, and benchmarking of different SAT solvers on CNF formulae.
- 🔧 **[Custom 3D Engine](https://github.com/William-Harmer/opengl-3d-simulation-engine)**  
    While the code isn’t production-ready and more experimental, I gained hands-on experience with object movement using matrices, multiple camera perspectives, first-person navigation, collision detection via octrees, OBJ model importation, and texture management.
- 🌐 **[Reale Camiceria](https://realecamiceria.co.uk/)**  
    Complete website rebuild while retaining the existing architecture, implemented according to the owners’ requirements.
